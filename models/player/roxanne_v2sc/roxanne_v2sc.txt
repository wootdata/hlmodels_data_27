Roxanne Model by Rat (Rick J. Kelley) 6/27/99

Just unzip into the players/roxanne directory and have fun.

My first model and I spent a lot of time on her, (to much!).
No team colors in this version.

If any of you are wondering why she has the femal assassins boots and
the femal assassins vest, it is becuase I took thos two textures from
the valve model as I am working on a mod that requires the femal
assassin in it, but I decided to create roxanne instead as a dangerous
assassin that is so good she wants her face to be seen. Notice her back
as she has a cool belt instead of the boring packs of ammo that the
assassin has in the hl game, and she has a cool ponytail of course!

I would like to thank White Dragon on all his help in explaining all the
different quirks of getting a model into half life. I couldnt have done
Roxanne if it wasnt for him! Check out his Onna model and others
